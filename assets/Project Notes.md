# Cargo Bot

## Requirements:
- Make a game similar to Cargo bot game.
- Make the challenges ourselves and make them increasingly more difficult:
  * Add obstacles to increase difficulty.
  * Time limit
  * Move limits.
- Modify cargo bot so that instead of using boxes, make it similar to Scratch. 
- Support return functions and recursion
- Support as many functions as possible
- Work on iPad and android tablets.
- Web based implementation to allow users to make their own levels. Users solve puzzles themselves to see if the level is viable. 
- Create a social media platform around cargo bot (Optional)
- Users can share the levels that they have made.

## Questions:
- Which social media platform do we use? – what does he even mean with the social media stuff?

## Technologies:
- Unity
- firebase – useful for games
- Have a system where a QR code contains all of the necessary code to build the levels.
- WebGL

# Centiport

## Requirements:
- remake of the classic 1980 Atari Centipede game
- It should be as similar to the original as possible, but an exact replica is not the main drive of the project.
- That is, it must run on at least 2 of the following platforms:
  * Windows
  * Mac (Preferred)
  * Linux
  * Ios 
  * Android
- Finally, the game must be developed in C++ using OS APIs directly.

# Food AI

## Requirements:
- Make a mobile phone app.
- Use generative AI to make you a recipe and how to make the item.
- A mobile app to take the photos.
- Image detection to identify objects.
- Generative AI to create a recipe.
- A way for a user to save a recipe.
- Maybe a way for the AI to learn what you like and recommend if there are multiple choices:
  * Ask the user what type of food that they like so that the AI can make a decision based on this. 
  * Allow users to swipe on different food options to decide (food tinder)
  * Have filters so that users can be more specific with what type of recipe they want. 
- Allow scaling of recipes to adjust for number of people. 

## Technologies:
- Dart
- Flutter

## Next steps:
- Figure out what the roles are - Platform Specialists, Abstraction Layer Specialists, Platform-agnostic gameplay programmers.
- Play the game and get more familiar with the rules. – Centiport and Cargo Bot
- Research on how to develop both of these games. – Centiport and Cargo Bot
- Find database for images for food – food AI.
