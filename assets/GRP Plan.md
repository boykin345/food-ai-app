# Reflection on Previous Meeting

I understand that our last meeting didn't go as planned. I appreciate the team's feedback and view it as an essential learning opportunity. Thank you for trusting me with your feedback.

**Note:** Geert's upcoming lecture on Tuesday will address how to approach EOI and Video Pitch. It's a good chance for us to review our plans. Also, I spoke to him and he said that if there's ambiguity in the requirements, it's intentional. It's our job to interpret and plan accordingly.

# Action Points for Team Members

## Post-final Project Allocation
- I'll provide a CV template, sample and checklist. Create and send your CV versions to me. We can then discuss needed changes if necessary in 1-to-1 calls, which will last around 15-20 minutes each.

## Before Monday's Meeting
- Compile a list of preferred frameworks, libraries, and technologies.
- Prepare any sketches or diagrams of the workflow and how various technologies you propose interact.
- Come up with ways to meet each requirement from the notes.

## Post-Monday's Meeting
- Work on the EOI based on the below requirements. We'll allocate 2-3 members per EOI, split the workload accordingly and collaborate to finalize them.
- This can be worked over during the week and finished by the weekend.

# Additional Notes

- I won't be available on Monday 16th due to personal reasons, if needed, we'll find additional meeting times.
- After the meeting on Monday 9th, EOI, review the sample provided for the EOI:

## Contingencies

### PowerPoint Completion
Should we not complete the PowerPoint presentation by the close of Monday 9th, we will divide into three focused groups. Each group will be tasked with crafting one distinct presentation. I'll provide a foundational sample to guide each team, but it's imperative to finalize these presentations either by the end of Monday or, at the latest, by Tuesday afternoon. This ensures we have ample time for review and revisions.

### Diagrams & Sketches
In the event that team members don't produce preliminary diagrams or sketches, we'll need to allocate specific people post-meeting to design these visuals for our presentations.
