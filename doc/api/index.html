  <h1 id="food-ai-brief">Food AI Brief</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Team 31's Food AI Project</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever found yourself looking inside your fridge trying to figure out what to eat? Our Food AI project aims to deal with this age-old issue with generative AI packaged in an easy-to-use yet feature-rich mobile application.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>
<p>Generate recipes that the user will like in only four simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set up your preferences, allergies, etc., and tell the app what cooking equipment you have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a photo of your fridge, and an image detection component will help identify possible ingredients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch as recipes are generated for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swipe left if you're not interested or swipe right if you're feeling hungry, and the recipe will be shown to you in its full glory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>User-friendly user interface</li>
<li>Accessibility options and testing</li>
<li>Recipe saving and organisation</li>
<li>Safe, diverse, and high-quality recipes with detailed instructions and warnings</li>
<li>Personalisation and fine-tuning of recipes and user settings</li>
<li>Social media integration</li>
<li>CI/CD pipeline</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-stories">User Stories</h2>
<p>Below are the user stories that we will be using for our product backlog. We have given codes at the start of each user story so that they can be tracked across the various diagrams that we have made.

<h2 id="technologies">Technologies</h2>
<p>Firebase: Back-End Development
Firebase provides our app with a reliable and scalable back-end solution. It's ideal for managing user data, handling authentication, and storing recipe information efficiently.</p>
<p>Flutter: Front-End Development
We're using Flutter for front-end development, allowing us to create a visually appealing and responsive interface for our food app across multiple platforms with a single codebase.</p>
<p>GPT API: Recipe and Image Generation
The GPT API is integrated for its advanced AI capabilities, particularly in generating creative recipe suggestions and food-related content, enhancing the user experience with innovative features.</p>
<h2 id="testing-strategy-and-frameworks">Testing Strategy and Frameworks</h2>
<p>For this project, we are committed to adopting a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure high-quality, reliable software. Our testing strategy encompasses a combination of powerful tools, including <em>flutter_test</em>, <em>mockito</em>, and <em>integration_test</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>flutter_test
<ul>
<li>Flutter_test is the central component of our unit and widget testing. We can thoroughly test our Flutter widgets and underlying Dart functionality thanks to this framework. We make sure that every element works as intended, both separately and as a part of the larger user interface (UI), by simulating user interactions and validating widget behaviours in a controlled environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mockito
<ul>
<li>We use mockito as an addition to our unit testing. With the help of this tool, we can easily create mock&nbsp;objects for our tests, which helps us to test and isolate particular components separately from external dependencies. This method improves the accuracy of our testing while also accelerating it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration_test
<ul>
<li>For our integration testing requirements, we use integration_test. This framework helps us verify that the application functions smoothly overall and that all of its parts cooperate well&nbsp;from the user's point of view.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will&nbsp;also utilise User-Driven Development (UDD) since we understand that not all functionalities lend themselves to automated testing, especially when working with external APIs like the GPT API. With this approach, we work closely with our users to collect input and iterate to improve features that are difficult to test the traditional way.</p>
<p>In the development and testing phase of our Food AI project, we will also leverage emulators in Firebase, allowing our team to efficiently test and validate features before deploying to the cloud. Firebase emulators provide a convenient and cost-effective way to test and debug Firebase functionality.</p>

<h2 id="coding-and-maintainability-conventions">Coding and Maintainability Conventions</h2>
<p>Throughout the project, we're going to keep the bar for readability and code quality high. We have decided to use the <a href="https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style">Google Dart Style Guide</a>. This manual offers thorough instructions for creating idiomatic, consistent, and understandable Dart code. It is recommended that all team members become acquainted with this style guide in order to maintain consistency throughout our codebase.</p>
<p>Maintaining the integrity of our codebase is largely the responsibility of our Git administrator. Each merge request will be examined by them to ensure that our coding standards are being followed. This entails a careful examination for readability, consistency, and adherence to the Dart style guide.</p>
<p>We plan to incorporate the Flutter linter into our development workflow in order to enhance our code quality assurance even more. Our code will be automatically examined by this tool to see if it complies with accepted coding standards and best practices.
As a first line of defence, the linter will spot any possible problems and inconsistencies in our code. It will lessen the workload associated with manual code reviews and ensure a more seamless and effective development process by assisting us in identifying and fixing issues early in the development cycle.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>We wish for our project to be an easy way for anyone to come up with something to eat, and as a result, we will work hard to ensure that our application will have a high degree of accessibility. We intend to achieve this by following the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Acessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> which defines a set of standards that improve the quality of Web (and application) content for people with disabilities, including but not limited to visual, auditory, and physical. If time allows, we will implement features such as light/dark themes, alternate colour palettes for colourblind people, text-to-speech/speech-to-text functionality, and test a variety of screen readers on our application.</p>
